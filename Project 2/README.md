For Project 2 Part 1, download the Project2_Part1.m file and run it on MATLAB. The code creates a track on a graph and 4 different segments. The dimensions of this graph are based on the given parameters of a 900-meter straightaway and a 200-meter radius on circular turns. The 4 include 2 straight paths and 2 circular turns. For straight segments, x-coordinates increase while y-coordinates remain the same. For curved segments, it calculates the position of the car based on cosine and sine functions. A rectangular block represents a car, along with an animated blue line following its path, and drives around this track. During the test, the position and orientation of the car are updated using a transformation matrix. This ensures that the animation of the car provides smooth turns throughout the circular parts of the track.
