Part 2 Notes:

For this portion of the code, every file is labeled part 2 with an associated option number with both a Matlab Script file and a Simulink file. If you open each associated file, run the script first, then the Simulink, then the script again, it should produce some angular velocity plots.

Explanation of errors: Due to errors in Part 1, our part 2 also suffered. Upon running the script, it is apparent due to the time needed to complete the running of the file and the response from the simulink window, that they are iterating together. However, upon hours of testing, we were never able to see the to workspace files produced by the simulink in the script workspace which lets us know it was not actually storing the data from all of the simulations in the workspace. So the plot produced, if produced, is just the last simulation run in the actual simulink window. We tried, but were never successful in getting adequate cooperation between the two.

Additionally, in the Simulink for Option 3, we had consistent issues with the torque input file. The torque subsystem was the same as used in the other 2 simulink files, but was not compatible with this one which led to issues we were unable to debug.

Final Notes:

Thank you for looking through this. We understand the project did not come together to the standard in which we were hoping for, but we belive we were extremely close to an adequate final solution that we put representative effort in for, and we hope this reflects in the foundations of our work.
